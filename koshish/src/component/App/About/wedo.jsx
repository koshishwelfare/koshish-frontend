  {/* Main Description */}
  <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
    We read, we play, we paint, and we do experiments. Quite understandably, we also provide financial help to some really needy students. There's a library to foster learning and support their studies. Students are also taught music in their free time.  
    Beyond academics, we instill moral and social values like discipline, punctuality, and awareness about various social issues. Our volunteers even visit the students' homes in villages to better understand their challenges.
